# Html-Css-Capstone-GlobalConcert
This capstone project is to build for the HTML &amp; CSS Technical Microverse curriculum based on an online website for a conference. I am to follow the given design of the website, but I must personalise the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course.
