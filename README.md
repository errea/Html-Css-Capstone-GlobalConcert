# Html-Css-Capstone-GlobalConcert

This capstone project is to build for the HTML &amp; CSS Technical Microverse curriculum based on an online website for a conference. I am to follow the given design of the website, but I must personalise the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course.

## Week 1  HTML5 Collaborative Microverse Project

This project was created as a clone of the New York Times - Article Page.
The collaborative Coding experience was an amazing experience, spending time and holding each other accountable  to learn and  create this project from ground was fun. I was sure to complete the project and understan every bits in details.

This project was my  first experience with the use of linters, which was great and understandable.

>Skills Revived & Learned:

- Versioning & best practices of maintaining branches of safe deployed and local dev
- git flow & Github flow
- HTML, CSS new and better elements, semantics, features etc
- Cloning - the hard work and skills needed to successfully make a clone.
- Linter - install & fix tests {still not managed to get styleint to run on VSC locally}
- Collaborative learning, being patient, helping each other succeed.
- Attending Daily standup, being focused, accountable.

>## Learning Goals

- Version Control & CSS
- Introduction to HTML & CSS concepts.
- Position, Flex, Floats
- Embeds and image manipulating
