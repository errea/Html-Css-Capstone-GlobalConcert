# Html-Css-Capstone- Music Global Concert

This capstone project is designed to meet the HTML CSS Technical Microverse curriculum based on an online website for a conference. I am to follow the given design of the website, but I must personalise the content and be creative, i.e., instead of a conference concert I decided to build a Music concert.

## Week 4  HTML/CSS  Microverse Capstone Project

This project was created to reflect the RWD pattern for website. I had to start with the mobile responsiveness.
The project was solo but at the same time I had my coding partner and I working for accounttabuility and ideas. I was sure to complete the project and understand every bit of the details.

>Skills Revived & Learned:

- Versioning & best practices of maintaining branches of safe deployed and local dev
- Git flow & Github flow Practice
- HTML, CSS semantics, features  and best practice (DRY)etc
- Using CSS framework like Bootstrap for RWD
- Cloning - the hard work and skills needed to successfully make a clone.
